# 🎟️ Ticketi – Event Ticketing & Resale Platform (WIP)

**Ticketi** is a web-based event ticketing platform designed to make it easy for users to create events, buy tickets, and resell them when plans change. Built with a React frontend and Flask backend, Ticketi aims to be a complete ticketing ecosystem — from event discovery to dynamic ticket resale.

---

## 🚀 Vision

Ticketi is more than just a place to buy tickets. It’s a flexible marketplace where users:

- Organize and list events
- Buy multiple tickets for those events
- Resell unused tickets at **peak**, **off-peak**, or **standard** rates

Whether you’re a host or an attendee, Ticketi empowers users to engage with events on their own terms.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🖼️ Event Creation
- Users sign up and log in.
- Logged-in users can create events by providing:
  - Event name
  - Image URL
  - Location
  - Ticket price

### 💸 Buying Tickets
- Users can browse all events.
- Each event has a detail view where users can purchase one or more tickets.

### 🔁 Reselling Tickets *(Coming Soon)*
- Users who’ve bought tickets will soon be able to:
  - Resell them to others
  - Choose resale pricing based on peak/off-peak demand
