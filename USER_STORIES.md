# Ticketi User Stories & Product Vision

This document outlines the user-centric vision for the Ticketi application. Our goal is to move beyond a functional prototype and create a delightful, modern, and intuitive user experience.

## The Core Vision: "Sleek, Seamless, and Alive"

The application must feel modern, professional, and satisfying to use. Every interaction should be smooth, and the user should always feel in control and informed.

## Part 1: The User Experience Overhaul

### 1.1. The Landing Page Experience
*   **As a new user,** I want to be greeted by a dynamic and visually appealing landing page, not just a list of events.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The landing page features a large "hero" section with a beautiful background image and a clear call-to-action (e.g., a prominent search bar).
    *   The page has curated sections like "Popular Events" or "Happening This Weekend."
    *   The page allows browsing by category.

### 1.2. The Ticket Purchase Flow
*   **As a user,** I want the process of buying a ticket to feel like a secure and professional checkout experience, not just clicking a button.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Clicking "Buy Ticket" opens a multi-step checkout modal.
    *   Step 1: User selects ticket quantity, and the total price updates dynamically.
    *   Step 2: User is presented with a mock payment form (e.g., for name and card number) to simulate a real transaction.
    *   Step 3: A clear confirmation screen is shown after "payment," with a link to view the ticket.

### 1.3. The Event Creation Flow
*   **As an event organizer,** I want the process of creating an event to be an intuitive, guided journey.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Event creation is a multi-step "wizard."
    *   Step 1: Basic event details (name, description, category).
    *   Step 2: Location selection, featuring an **interactive map** where I can drop a pin.
    *   Step 3: Ticketing details (date, time, price, capacity).

### 1.4. The Ticket Reselling Flow
*   **As a ticket holder,** I want to be able to easily list a ticket I own for resale.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   In my "My Tickets" page, there is a clear "Resell Ticket" button on tickets I own.
    *   Clicking the button allows me to set a resale price.
    *   The ticket is then marked as "For Resale" and appears in a special section of the marketplace.

## Part 2: The "FEEL" - A Modern Design System

### 2.1. Visual Design
*   **As a user,** I want the application to look sleek, modern, and trustworthy.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The application uses a sophisticated and professional color palette (e.g., a dark theme with a single, vibrant accent color).
    *   The layout is clean, with generous whitespace and a strong visual hierarchy.
    *   Typography is clean, modern, and legible.

### 2.2. Micro-interactions and Animations
*   **As a user,** I want the application to feel alive and responsive to my actions.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Interactive elements (like cards and buttons) have subtle hover and press animations.
    *   Page transitions are smooth and non-jarring (e.g., a quick fade).
    *   Loading states are elegant "skeleton" screens that mimic the content being loaded, instead of generic spinners.
